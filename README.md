## Rules -
Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie.

As Dr.Sheldon Cooper(Fictional Charcter) explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
